# Data Mining
Compilation of my solutions to data mining module exercises.
Below is an outline of the topics/tools covered in each of the assignments.
Libraries used include: beautiful soup, cubes, matplotlib, numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, scipy, seaborn


## Assignment 1
* Binning techniques
* Normalisation methods
* Chi-squared testing and significance values
* Cleaning missing data and interpolation methods (preprocessing)
* Data exploration and visualisation
* Scatter plots and Pearson's correlation coefficient
* Principal component analysis (PCA) and explained variance ratio
* Box plots and summary statistics (univariate/multivariate)
* Distance matrices
* Multidimensional scaling (MDS)


## Assignment 2
* Data warehousing and schemas
* Data cube and OLAP operations
* Bitmap index tables
* Aggregate measures from constructed data cube model (JSON)
* Classification and clustering
* Euclidean distance and k-nearest neighbour classifiers
* Interpretation of precision and recall
* Confusion matrices
* Support vector machine (SVM)
* Grid search for hyperparameter selection


## Assignment 3
* Apriori algorithm
* Association rules and support
* Kulczynski measure and imbalance ratio
* Outlier detection - using maximum likelihood estimation, PCA and one-class SVM classifier approaches


## Assignment 4
* Web mining - scraping data from webpages
* Basic HTML
* Constructing a clean dataframe from scraped data
* PageRank algorithm
* Text and timeseries mining
* Document-term matrix (TF-IDF) and preprocessing (e.g. stop word removal)
* Autoregressive models (e.g. ARIMA)
* K-means clustering
